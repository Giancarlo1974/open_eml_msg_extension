## üìÑ How to Use the `.msg/.eml` Auto-Redirect Script

This extension automatically intercepts clicks on links to `.msg` or `.eml` files and redirects them to a custom URL protocol (e.g., `emlopen://`), allowing native applications to handle these files directly.

---

### üß† What It Does

- Listens for mouse clicks (`mousedown`) on `<a>` elements.
- Intercepts links that:
  - End with `.msg` or `.eml`, **or**
  - Return the MIME type `application/vnd.ms-outlook` in a `HEAD` request.
- Prevents the browser's default behavior.
- Redirects the user to a custom protocol URL like:
emlopen://github.com/Giancarlo1974/open_eml_msg_extension/raw/refs/heads/main/test.msg

---

### ‚úÖ Requirements

- Files must be served via HTTP(S) with correct headers.
- A native application must be registered on the client machine to handle the `emlopen://` protocol.
- The web server must serve `.msg` files with the appropriate `Content-Type`.

---

### üåê Nginx Configuration Example

To properly serve `.msg` files with the correct headers using **Nginx**, use the following configuration:

```nginx
location ~* \.msg$ {
  default_type application/vnd.ms-outlook;
  add_header Content-Disposition "inline";
  root /var/www/html;
  try_files $uri =404;
}
```

üí° This configuration ensures that .msg files are served with the MIME type application/vnd.ms-outlook, which is required for proper detection by the script.


### üß™ Example Usage
üëâ [**/open_eml_msg_extension/raw/refs/heads/main/test.msg**](https://github.com/Giancarlo1974/open_eml_msg_extension/raw/refs/heads/main/test.msg)
When the user clicks this link:
- A HEAD request checks the file's MIME type.
- If it matches a .msg/.eml file or the MIME type application/vnd.ms-outlook, the click is intercepted.
- The browser is redirected to a custom URL scheme (e.g., emlopen://...).
- A registered native application handles the custom URL and opens the file.
